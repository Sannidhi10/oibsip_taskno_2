      11th President of the country from 2002 and 
      2007 and is also popularly known as the

      Bharat Ratna in 1997. He is also known for a 
      humble and respectful attitude towards people
      and was called the 'People's President'. 
      After the country, he went back to delivering 
      lectures to students and writing. He died 
      after suffering cardiac arrest while delivering 
      a lecture at Indian Institute of Management Shillong
